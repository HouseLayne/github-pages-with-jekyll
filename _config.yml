  This is a test site. Perhaps it will become my eigene site when I start feeling comfortable with all this. Nearly there. 

# social links
twitter_username: your-twitter-handle # DO NOT include the @ character, or else the build will fail!
github_username:  your-github-handle # DO NOT include the @ character, or else the build will fail!

show_excerpts: true # set to false to remove excerpts on the homepage
