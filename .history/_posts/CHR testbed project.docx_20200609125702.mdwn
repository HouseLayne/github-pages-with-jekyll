# The UWC Centre for Humanities Research as archival testbed

## Summary

This document is part of a series of proposals to revitalise the archival life of the University of the Western Cape. It invites the Centre for Humanities Research (CHR) to further institutionalise its curatorial practice, contributing to the incremental growth of ‘infrastructures’ across the university. The White Paper series of which this document is part, makes recommendations about trust and ethics in archives, the[a] implications of continuous technological change unfolding incrementally across the university over the next several years. The CHR holds several collections as well as records of key critical debates in the humanities. The focus is on metadata, with a challenge to systematically and incrementally enrich and systematise metadata between and beyond the ebb and flow of project funding. In archive-speak, this means the Centre needs to grow its metadata muscles in order to curate this archive, to realise the potentials contained there. The archive project defines work that would help reduce obstacles to an archival workflow between the centre (and other centres) on one hand, and the university collections on the other (including the Mayibuye RIM collections, the University Archives, and various other academic holdings) deposit[b] and deployment, and this document seeks to maximise the alignment between the CHR’s work in relation to the emerging archival infrastructure.

# Openings. The sensory and the machinic archive

The different kinds of archives at UWC have a common commitment to social justice and care. This behoves a concern with the aesthetics, politics and ethics of our work as scholars, artists and archivists. How can this archival project assist our capacity to resist oppression and develop a politics of care in the present and the future? This refers to care in thought and reflection, centred in the university community and extending out into the world. How can we in the university think effectively about resistance today, in environments that are often anti-intellectual and depoliticised?
In this work, the archive can evoke the both the sensorium and the machine. As the historian Arlette Farge puts it, ‘The archive lays things bare, and in a few crowded lines you can find not only the inaccessible but also the living’. She continues: ‘Scraps of lives dredged up from the depths wash up on shore before your eyes. Their clarity and credibility are blinding’ (2015: 8). What is it about the archives that produces this clarity and credibility? And what is the value of the archive, specifically of those archives we hold at the University of the Western Cape (UWC)? What do they mean for the humanities, both on our campus and far beyond? How does the memory within them burn, as Georges Didi-Huberman puts it? The archive forces the reader to engage with it in very challenging ways. Farge speaks of being captivated by the archive, of ‘the sensation of having finally caught hold of the real’, and a ‘profound feeling of tearing away a veil’ (8). This vivid impression that might carry more intensity than truth requires a response at different levels. It needs interpretive tools and craft to decipher these materials, which is the ground of the humanities disciplines[c]. 
Yet archival mediation demands its reckoning. The archive is also abstract, machinic, concerned with technologies of care, storage retrieval and description. Contrasting the sensory allure of the original document, we have the ‘cold’ archival machine, which issues `command’ from its technical modalities rather than from human authors. We become alert to the enmeshed character of archival pursuits, the many different ways to be an archive, its increasing ties and dependency on the digital and, equally, and its dependency on ‘backwards compatability’ towards older analogue forms[d]. Format change is rapid and permanent, even as newer digital formats ’become’ metadata, needing to jump from format to format, technology to technology. The archive, if it is to claim its trustworthy moniker, has to worship both analogue and digital gods. It must be geared for analogue preservation yet also at the cutting edge of change, of the web, artificial intelligence, blockchain and data scholarship. Archives live with unbearable pressure from the past as well as the future. Perhaps this contrast describes a continuum of approaches to the archive: the archive as sensorium and the archive as mediated, as ‘reverse engineered epistemology’. The analogue/ digital binary is however insufficient. There is much that cannot be captured in the analogue term. For example, the aesthetics of the relation between the human and the machine is a major line of enquiry inside the CHR. This programme, like all others, produces its own research modalities, its own curatorial possibilities, and hence its own archive
What might it mean to hold this core value system in developing a dynamic infrastructure of care in which these archival modes have productive tension? As we build archival infrastructures the concept of the incremental is a key guiding concept. Given the legacies we inherit we require systemic incrementalism. Archival systems rely on standardisations, the quest to deploy the machinic to impose order. They also rely on an unambiguous pursuit of the ethical, of the pursuit of trustworthiness over the longue duree[e].
# Mediations of archive and scholarship
For the Archives project, a key point of departure is the capacity to build a trustworthy archival infrastructure. The CHR represents a critical constituency for archives. Here trust builds on the CHR’s reputation as a centre of critical scholarly and artistic debate. By implication, it asks for archival indicators alongside the scholarly ones. This has its own implications aligning with the critique of the digital humanities and raises additional questions. Trustworthiness means not only being able to tell someone that you are doing preservation well, but being able to show that you are doing it well because it is documented, certified. 
As Nancy McGovern reminded a workshop, irrelevance is one of the biggest threats. For the sake[f] of being permanent, secure, compliant, we risk becoming rigid and irrelevant. So excited about the challenges to boundaries of archives seen in this archive[g]. We need to see the benefit of a rational approach, while also finding and encouraging innovation that is challenging to our assumptions about what an archive is and what it should be doing. 
Digitisation pipeline. Only one stage for reformatting. But the lead up and follow up are really important. Accreditaiton of archives becomes a key question. 
Keith Breckenridge cautioned that the biggest challenge is getting a common political project. Make case for large amounts of new money. Move to a better resourced long-term project of digitising the university. VCs look to digitisation as a cost saving strategy - HR replacement. Replace the expensive people with cheap software. 
But in fact building the digital university requires substantial new expenditure. Change the priorities of people who draw up budgets. We can no longer get soft money from the Americans for much longer. 
For humanities - how to get students to read, need the old skills of humanism in SA. We have an industrial model of humanities. Students do humanities against the univ procedure. The humanities has died and been colonised by big corporations. 
The business model for publications doesnt work for unique collections eg archives. A narrative of whats important is imposed. But doesnt take into account that non digitised is where new knowledge is gleaned[h]. 
The critique of the hidden power structures in the digital humanities is consistent with the critique of global apartheid. This does not mean, for example, refusing standards, but avoiding standards that take over objects, practices, and processes that they should serve. The historical character of the humanities disciplines [global inequality] has contributed to an excessive concentration on conservation, management, and data analysis, while neglecting the more revolutionary contribution (in both a positive and a negative sense) of computing and its capacity to affect research processes even before they produce anything. "So, the cultural law is written the North.
# An intellectual genealogy of the CHR
Intellectual Challenges
The CHR offers such a starting point. What would such an interface between humanist and archive manifest? The archive is both its modes of authority and the legacies of its scholarship. The CHR was created as an ongoing reflection on the university’s legacies. This occurs in tandem with a conversation about the university globally. In this, the axis of science and humanities is at a critical place. In addition to the beginnings of its present building as the library, the CHR has produced a considerable body of work since it began:
* Family histories in the Western Cape and Mission stations (under Prof. J Bredekamp)
* Seminar series
* Museum and heritage studies
* Visual history
* Documentary Film
                
* The CAP Project
* The becoming technical of the human and LoKO
* Factory of the Arts
* Biopolitics
There is now the prospect of a new building for hte archival project, and the Greatmore Building to factor in. 
Moreover, with its present intellectual riches, there is opportunity to build bridges across the humanities and the sciences. The astrology visit has given us an opening. Computer sciences and other relevant research interfaces are yet to be explored. Given the importance of ICS in this future, that would be a valuable relationship to cultivate.
Curatorial/ technical activities
The challenge is to build the systems and people for the required workflows between the centre and its archives on one hand, and between the centre and the emerging archival project. In other words, the challenge is for the centre to model the UWC archives it wants. This process would consist of a dialogue, a conversation and a workflow with multiple nodes reaching inwards - through the different sites and campuses now emerging - and outwards - to a local and international scholarly community and its publics. There is a curatorial opportunity to build archival capacities - including the technical ones - in the CHR’s research practice. 
- Open up to many diverse, incremental contributions with goals of discovery, access, meaningful use of archives. These are the building blocks of infrasrtucture. 
A. Build wihot the security of having a target. Radical, you dont have a way of knowing whats there at the end. You’re never done. Focus on more on use, demand, practice. 
A. Preservation of the ephemeral. We hold great masterwork as the gold standard. That kind of thinking is backwards for digital arts. There is no original. Archives and art are surrogates for experience. You cant preserve it but you can provide a spark for future person to relive it[i]. 
We need reduncancy in the human capability. People who can fill in for each other. Whats the human skill backup. Thats real fragility. User demand is protection against fragility. If all township schools depend on your archive, if that dies, theres impact. Make sure enough people care about it and will notice when its gone. 
It may help to think in terms of a transition to a more integrated dialogue with the sciences. It positions narrative humanities in conversation with the symbolic. It explores content and `beyond content’. 
 Metadata - a continuum of humanistic and technical knowledge
The critical step, as we have emphasised, is to build expert descriptions of objects in the collections - describing the artefacts themselves, their preservation condition, the scholarship that informs the object and the technical mediations that continue to apply. Yet there are gaps in our current ability to prepare for archival deposit. What is metadata for this purpose? This may be almost self evident in one register. In order for the user of an archive to access material they need to know a few things about that object. Metadata usually means a standardisable way of doing this. Metadata schemas such as Dublin Core make the material useable by communities of scholars, artists and publics. Much of the work will happen in removing the obstacles to the creation of reliable metadata. The resource challenges are taken as given. 
The duality of archives as sensory and as machine - mentioned in the introduction to this document - is relevant here. Metadata, as the term implies, the mediation of the archive. This mediation is usually the subject of critical discussion in the CHR. In the case of born digital materials, the ‘metadata’ is harder to distinguish from the ‘content’. 
Interoperability is a key challenge in the South African context. The system promises low barriers to interoperability. It enables the harvesting of metadata between institutions. 
Meanwhile, the university’s eLearning unit would like to put in place a budget which allows them to explore needs both in the humanities and in the sciences, and to start to develop an infrastructure that will allow them to extend infrastructure to new services. Astronomy and bioinformatics are two fields where UWC has made major inroads in terms of e-research. We need to leverage on these strengths in order to transfer to other fields.Would like to be able to extend infrastructure that they are developing to new use cases. UWC already has infrastructures. They need reform. And we need to grow additional branches, nodes.
The CHR would therefore be encouraged to build a workflow between the centre and its archives on one hand, and between the centre and the emerging archival infrastructures on the other hand. In other words, the challenge is for the centre to model the archive it wants to see. This means preparing to
* Promote the archive as a place for visiting scholars. Prepare the ground. 
* Add an archival practice to its existing practice in the seminars and coursework - LoKO, Documentary film, Factory[j]. 
All such initiatives depend on the development of a well-defined metadata set. That is where the ongoing work lies. This is what the best scholarship will do[k], and it begins by aligning the labours of the archivist with that of the scholar. It matters less whether the same individual plays both parts, or whether there exists a specialisation of roles. The engagement, alignment and flow between the scholars/ artists on one hand, and the archivists on the other will be all-important. Moreover, in addition to the conceptual, the practical end of this conversation matters. The technical cannot simply be the instrument of the artistic or conceptual here. The curatorial and technical challenges are intertwined and invite integrated approaches to research and teaching with archival material, processes and questions. It calls for an appropriate plan, modelling how the university as a whole might archive output in the humanities, and across the disciplines. 
While Open Data promises much in the way of reduced costs, it makes critical assumptions about access to skills and competencies. In this gap, there may also be opportunity to build archival capacities - including the technical ones - in the CHR’s research practice. There are massive gaps in our current ability to prepare for archival deposit. In building these infrastructures inside a research centre, we refer to the capacity to meet the archival interface in achieving ingest, preservation, and dissemination of archived materials.
Digital is fashionable, moreso after the Covid moment. At the same time, it is harder to spend on backwards compatibility, and even harder to raise funding for this critical archival function. Yet, there is no archive without it. As argued elsewhere in these papers, the past year’s work confirms that our infrastructures should privilege preservation in its full spectrum. It warns against blindly following ‘digital’ fashion without holding the reach of the analogue. This is where opportunities and the challenges are. 
This is not to ignore the massive opportunities in the digital sphere, but to hold it with greater clarity. So a strategy is to engage the digital fashion without succumbing to its all-consuming threat. Build infrastructures that immunise us from the threat, to harness the digital in an ethics defined and produced in the Global South. The digital itself needs a critique of its global north biases. Any implementation must include this critique in its materiality, its forms. 
The system and the CHR interface
The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) offers a rational framework assisting in the containment of the digital explosion. It is almost universally accepted as the lingua franca of digital preservation, shaping and sustaining conversations about digital preservation across disparate domains, and supplying a general mapping of the landscape that stewards of our digital heritage must navigate in order to secure the long-term availability of digital materials. In the language of OAIS the CHR would work with the Submission Information Package. It would work to meet six minimum responsibilities to do with the ingest, preservation, and dissemination of archived materials.
In summary, an OAIS is expected to embody six high-level functional entities that, together with Common Services, constitute the mechanisms by which the OAIS preserves information over the long-term and makes it available to its Designated Community. An OAIS-type archive will implement each of these functional entities, in one form or another, in the course of building a complete archival system.
Project ideas: the Metadata challenge
The critical challenge with each of the projects listed here is to develop well-rounded curatorial resources for each, particularly the description and annotation of the objects in the collections. Hence we speak of a metadata challenge unique to each one. 
Revisiting restitution Making the Mayibuye Collection
From a discussion with Gordon Metz, one of the founding curators, it was the prospect of closure that gave the impetus to see the IDAF materials as a collection in its own right. This genealogical deperture has not been explored and may give grist to a revisiting of the Mayibuye collections as a curatorial project. Mayibuye is an archetype of the activist archive. The relation to the growth of public art on campus, for example, is ripe for consideration. Also the relation to the notion of ‘return’ is worth considering. 
Metz spoke of GM. More gatekeeping than secrecy. New power bases coming from outside, exiles disconnected from outside, now have to find their footing. There was more of a welfare dynamic. Complete chaos. 
Ann Frank Exhibition. Lots of correspondence about positioning in the new SA. Jewish Board of Deputies. 
A genealogy - Why no arts at UWC? Foundational impulse, Early exhibitions of Mayibuye Centre, public art at UWC, emerging culture of secrecy/ gatekeeping.  
CAP Art Collection
The metadata challenge in the case of the CAP collection consists of a need to consolidate institutional memory. Different collections seem to have merged. This is an inventory and provenance project. It implies a revisitng of the taxonomies deployed in the acquisition of the collection from the Community Arts Project. Was called the CAP art collection. Reproduce CAPs own distinction between political paraphenalia, linocuts and artworks. The different taxonomies were part of the split in CAP. They arrived seperatly because of that. They come to be visible in the institution along that line. 
The CAP acquisition coincided with a particular moment in the CHR. Emile Maurice carried much institutional memory. The growth of the collection, and the attendant gaps all speak to that time. There are questions of provenance and of the original agreements.

Digital metadata. 
Athlone in Mind
Athlone in Mind. A not-yet collection. Has generated an archive of filmed interviews, Vakalisa, CAP, cultural worker scene. Emile, Michail Rassool was working on it. Heidi is holding the hard drive. Established under Emile, 2015. 2015 Factory of the Arts was established, without formal university support. Collapsed. Messy politics. Poster exhibition came after Uncontained. Based on CAP. Beautiful exhibition called Interruptions. Shown at City Hall. At Micaela’s pc.  
CHR Website
A long term review of the existing website may also think about the archival along these integrated lines. What would be the consituent set of questions to pose in this endeavour? 
The website has an existing brief - to showcase and integrate the CHR’s core work. 
How would the website enact an archival infrastructure along the suggested incrementalist lines?

Alt Text, Kim
Kim Gurney’s project is an adaptation of a data mapping technology to an art project. This is a beginning. Which questions can we ask in making also a critique of the field?[1]  
Alt Text signals a new constellation of research outputs and related work for the CHR that have in common a digital specificity central to their meaning. Examples might include digital storymaps, audiomaps, soundscapes, video and other kinds of online manifestations. This in-house platform provides a place to render such digital forms, offer broader accessibility for this kind of scholarly work, and to extend the notion of what kind of ‘objects’ we can produce to think with as the Humanities also responds to new times and challenges. 
The idea is motivated in part by the increasing relevance of multimedia formats for CHR researchers to achieve multiple registers and modalities as well as to reach different audiences. This is particularly relevant for arts-based research where form and content have a reciprocal relationship that may sometimes find most appropriate expression in digital form. It also recognises that our lives are increasingly mediated, not least by the current global pandemic, which has migrated aspects of the everyday online and generated all sorts of externalities. The intention is not to double down on the potential closures this induces but rather help unsettle them by deploying the digital as a portal towards new possibilities and lines of flight for the imaginary. 
Triple Canopy, an independent publisher, points out a prescient comment from Nietszche, quoted from an 1882 letter he wrote upon receiving a typewriter: “Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts.” This is true of any medium and the digital likewise works on our thoughts. Its modalities can also be repurposed and subverted, however, as disruptive and creative agents. For instance texts that are nested, recursive and nonlinear may be well served by digital means. 
Kim Fortuin (2010: ii) asks how texts can help carry arguments, “operating not only as delivery devices but as messages in themselves, compelling statements in their form”. Form is paramount, Fortuin insists, because it enacts meaning; the challenge is to get text to carry argument and perform an analysis (xii, original emphasis). “The right textual structure emerges from the material it structures” (Fortuin, 2010: xiii-xiv). Alt Text will encourage the running of narrative and other experiments that help generate insight and new meanings, in particular through digital forms.
It is informed by a sensibility of producing work from a particular South African city of the global South, in a world of shifting geopolitics where information technology like other democratic dividends is differentially distributed, and conscious that inequalities of different kinds define online access. It is also a work in progress, and one that hopes to slow down rather than perpetuate digital vortices.
