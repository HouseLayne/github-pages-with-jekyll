Im still confused about how to structure pages on this site so that the landing page is better. 

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about how I eventually learn to do my own static blog site. But dont be put off. When I eventually achieve mastery over Github pages and Jekyll, this site will be filled with fascinating discussions of culture, the technical, the human and social justice.
